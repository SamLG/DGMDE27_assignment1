<!-- DISCLAIMER I tried to fix easypeasy with various methods so that it would
	 work appropriately. It only sets the height of the columns on load, and 
	 then doesn't adjust ever again. It is supposed to resize on window 
	 resize, but this is not working. I tried re-writing the js to fix the window resize, but it would not resize the elements. This means that overflow is a serious issue. I therefore removed easypeasy from the worst offenders the .headline div and following div, and instead used a method from https://css-tricks.com/fluid-width-equal-height-columns/, this method however does not work well for the more complex # of columns, creating unusual stacking which easypeasy does fix. -->

					<h3>The Idyllic Winter</h3>
					<p>&emsp;Winter in Vermont brings to mind, blankets of white snow, frosted pine trees, and children young and old enjoying the great outdoors. The iconic lyrics of Irving Berlin's "White Christmas" reflects the nostalgia and picturesque view of the white winter. Vermont's idyllic winters have also been noted by other artists as sung by Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald in "Moonlight in Vermont". The picture of Vermont is often of it's white cozy winters. Vermont's winters are an important part of local culture, ecology, and economy.</p>

						<h4>"White Christmas"</h4>
						<p>I'm dreaming of a white Christmas<br>
						Just like the ones I used to know<br>
						Where the treetops glisten<br>
						And children listen<br>
						To hear sleigh bells in the snow<br>
						... <br>
						And may all your Christmases be white</p>

					<h3>Pests</h3>
					<p>&emsp;We need a very cold winter in Vermont to keep certain pests at bay. Keeping mosquito and tick populations in check relies heavily on long bouts of below freezing weather. What does this mean for New England, with these warm winters?</p>

					<h3>Skiing and Other Winter Activities</h3>
					<p>&emsp;Vermont's economy relies on a good snowfall and cold weather. Many local businesses get the majority of their annual revenue during the winter months.</p>

					<h3>Other Winter Industries</h3>
					<p>&emsp;Tourism in Vermont is very important. Visitors who don't want to ski or snowboard have other measn of entertainment. Many tourists just come to see the snow, like leafpeepers come in the fall to view the changing of the leaves. Without a winter wonderland for tourists to enjoy, local businesses suffer.</p></section>

					<h3>Happiness</h3>
					<p>&emsp;For many Vermonters, myself included, if you have to put up with limited daylight, then the reward is beautiful snowy days. A cold or mild overcast days without snow make for mellow winters. Snow also serves as a reflector of light, upping our intake of vitamin d and literally making us happier.</p></section>
